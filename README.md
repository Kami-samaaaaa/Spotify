# My First Project: Spotify Datasets Analysis

This is my first data analysis project, where I explored Spotify datasets using Microsoft Excel for analysis and visualizations, and summarized the findings in a PowerPoint presentation.

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Spotify streaming data. The project primarily focuses on understanding trends in streams, artist popularity, and listener engagement, all visualized using Excel charts and summarized in a PowerPoint presentation.
